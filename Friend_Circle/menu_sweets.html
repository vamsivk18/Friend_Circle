        <h3>Gulab Jamun</h3>
        <p>Gulab jamun came to the country from erstwhile Persia (Iran) when Muslim rulers started arriving in India and establishing their dynasties here. These sweets are made of khoya, which is a ball-shaped milk powder. The khoyas are deep-fried and dipped in a sugary syrup, which is usually flavoured with saffron and rose water.</p>

        <h3>Rasagulla</h3>
        <p>Like sandesh, rasgulla is also made from chenna. These spherical dumplings are cooked in a sweet syrup until the juice infiltrates the dough. This sweet is so popular that two Indian states, West Bengal and Odisha have been feuding over it for years, with each claiming the rasgulla originated in their respective region.</p>

        <h3>Jalebi</h3>
        <p>Jalebi is a favourite among Indians. It is a hoop-shaped sweet made by deep-frying flour that is later soaked in a sugary syrup. Different versions of jalebi are also found in Iran and Turkey. The recipe of this humble dessert is found in many ancient Indian cookbooks, dating back to the 15th century. Jalebis taste best when served warm.</p>
