        <p>Also known as the ‘Awadhi biryani’, the Lucknowi Biryani stands out due to its cooking style, known as dum pukht. The meat (or chicken) infused with spices is partially cooked separately from rice, which is flavoured with saffron, star anise and cinnamon.</p>

        <h3>Bombay Biryani</h3>
        <p>Bombay Biryani is worth the trip to Mumbai in itself. It is composed of chicken (mutton or vegetables), fried and spiced potatoes, kewra water (screw pine) and dried plums that make the flavour distinctively sweet, tangy and aromatic.</p>
